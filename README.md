## Problem statement for the car-cost program:
Calculate the total cost (base cost plus add-on items like tax and license) 
of a used car that might fit into the budget of a typical 18-year-old student. 
In addition, calculate the monthly cost of the car using a 36-month payment schedule.
## Requirements for the car-cost program:
1.	Name the program car_cost.py.
1.	In the prolog (as comment statements), put in the following information: 
the program name, the problem statement, the authors’ names, the date, 
and unresolved bugs (if any).
1.	Prompt the user for the base price of the car he or she wants to buy, 
convert it to floating point, and store the information in a variable called base_price.
1.	Calculate the sales tax and store it in a variable called sales_tax. The formula is as follows: 
base price times 0.06
1.	Store the registration fee ($192.00) in a variable called registration.
1.	Store the dealer preparation fee ($200.00) in an appropriately named variable.
1.	Store the delivery fee ($120.00) in an appropriately named variable.
1.	Calculate the total cost of the car by adding up the base price and all the “extras,” 
and store the result in an appropriately named variable.
1.	Print out the total cost of the vehicle for the user’s information.
1.	Calculate the monthly payment with an assumed 9% interest rate compounded monthly for 3 years. 
Use the equation described on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_calculator#Monthly_payment_formula).
Store the payment information in an appropriately named variable. 
1.	Print out the payment as an integer number.
1. Run your program, and correct any errors you find. 
1. Be sure none of the words in your print statements run together. 
1.  Capture an image of your program execution for a $3000 used car. Alt-PrintSc captures the active window.
1.  Name the image "car-cost.jpg" and add it to this repository.
## Algorithm for your Budget program:
* Write an algorithm for the car-cost program below. 
* When you code the program, be sure to include elements of your algorithm as program comments.
